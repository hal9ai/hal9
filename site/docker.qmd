#### Configuration

Once the Hal9 Docker image is installed, you can use the provided administrator key to login to the admin console to view, monitor and configure settings across the system. Our team can assist during this process or provide additional technical resources for your team.

We partnered with [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) to support many authentication providers like Active Directory, OpenID and [SAML](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/saml); the full list is available in [Auth0's provider list](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/identity-providers). You can also configure cloud storage accounts and some of the product aesthetics, like the logo image. Once configured, you can use all the functionality available in hal9.com, but in your own infrastructure.
