## Manifests

Whenever a frontend event triggers a computation in a compute runtime, the Hal9 client generates a manifest containing
information required by the compute runtime to update the state of the app. The manifest is a JSON array, with each
entry representing a call to a function associated with a node. A manifest is generated for each compute runtime, so the
payload sent by the client consists of an array of manifests.

Here is an example of one such payload:

```json
{
    "manifests": [
        {
            "runtime": "r",
            "calls": [
                {
                    "node": "species_dropdown",
                    "fn_name": "on_select",
                    "args": [
                        {
                            "name": "value",
                            "value": "setosa"
                        }
                    ]
                },
                {
                    "node": "summary_table",
                    "fn_name": "html",
                    "args": []
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

In this example, we're calling the `on_select()` function of the `species_dropdown` node in the compute runtime `"r"`,
with the value of `"setosa"` for the `value` parameter and the `html()` function of the `summary_table` node with no
arguments.

## Computed Results

Upon evaluating the manifest, the compute runtime provides a similarly specified JSON array with the function return
values. As an example, the response to the above manifest could be

```json
{
    "responses": [
        {
            "runtime": "r",
            "calls": [
                {
                    "node": "species_dropdown",
                    "fn_name": "on_select",
                    "result": "setosa"
                },
                {
                    "node": "summary_table",
                    "fn_name": "html",
                    "result": "<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> avg_petal_length <\/th>\n  <\/tr>\n <\/thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1.462 <\/td>\n  <\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>" 
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
