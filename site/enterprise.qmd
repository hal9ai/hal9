Hal9's Enterprise plan is recommended if you work at a company with 200+ people. This plan enable your business users to answer data questions and find insights in seconds inside their own infrastructure with Hal9's conversational AI.

With this plan, your technical team can use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) to install Hal9 within your data center or private virtual cloud. Hal9 will then transform and visualize all data entirely in your infrastructure and only process metadata in Hal9's LLM API.

If you prefer walkthrough video describing the main concepts and installation steps we recorded [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gh3ubUOrI) for you. Otherwise, keep reading along.
