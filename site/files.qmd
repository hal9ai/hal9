Often, we want to use the data we have on local storage in our applications, and the good news is that this is very easy to do in Hal9. For this, when we are on the build apps page, all we have to do is select the first option that is under the prompts bar that says "create an app from a csv file", and then select our csv.

Immediately after selecting our csv file, the data will be displayed in a table and then we can introduce prompts and describe the app we want to build as we did in the *"Getting Started"* tutorial.

It is important to note that if we are not logged in, the created app will be publicly accessible and therefore, the uploaded data as well.
