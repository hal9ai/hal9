This guide aims to help you get started with Hal9 in your local development environment as quickly as possible.

You can also head over to the hosted demo at [https://hal9.com/new](https://hal9.com) without having to download or install things locally.

### Installation

Install Hal9 by running:

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}

## Python

```bash
pip install hal9
```

## R


```r
remotes::install_github("hal9ai/hal9", subdir = "r")
```

### Starter apps

The recommended way to bootstrap a new app is to use the `new` command:

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}

## Python

```python
import hal9 as h9
h9.new("asks for your name and prints hello")
```

## R

```r
library(hal9)
h9_new("asks for your name and prints hello")
```

:::

This creates a new directory `my_app/` with the minimal ingredients necessary to run the app.

Now that we have an app, we can launch the server and see it in action:

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}

## Python

```python
h9.start("my_app")
```

## R

```r
h9_start("my_app")
```

:::

A browser tab should now pop up, allowing you to make changes to the app.
