We are rolling out features to let you chat with any structured data source, no matter where it lives. Here is a short video that summarizes why and how.

With Hal9, you get generative AI for your data, meaning that, you can connect Hal9 to your data source and answer ChatGPT-like questions, it is that simple!

In this example we are connected to a Postgres database to answer the following questions:

* What are the sales by sales person by month?
* What are the sales for a sales person by day?
* How do sales people compare?
