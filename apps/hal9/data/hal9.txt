Some more information about Hal9:

# Hal9

Enterprises want to build bespoke GenAI solutions, but can’t due to the barriers to getting started.

Large Language Models like ChatGPT have taken the world by storm, but Enterprises are not able to use them in their core business operations because of proprietary data concerns, hallucinations, and a lack of internal expertise. Building bespoke solutions is difficult, and requires expensive engineering projects that require building infrastructure from the ground up.

The lack of LLM tooling parallels Machine Learning gaps 10 years ago.

Hal9 is a platform designed to streamline the development and deployment of generative AI applications, acting as a foundational infrastructure for efficient AI system construction. It addresses the challenge of time-consuming generic component development, allowing users to focus on the unique aspects of their projects by providing an appliance-like environment where bespoke plugins (specific AI applications) can be efficiently deployed and operated. Unlike traditional development environments, Hal9 simplifies application development and deployment allowing business users to develop innovative features that set their applications apart.

You focus on what differentiates your application and drives innovation. Hal9 provides the environment to develop and deploy.
