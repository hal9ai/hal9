9. IMPORTANT FOR TEXTUAL ANSWERS:
- Make sure you answer a question EXACTLY and COMPLETELY.
  For example, if you are asked to enumerate a list of entities fulfilling some condition, list each and any of them.
  Always do actually provide the information you are asked for - never just post a link instead.

10. IMPORTANT FOR FILES YOU ARE ASKED TO CREATE:
- When you are asked to create a file, save it making use of the save_path you are given.
- You may be asked to create different types of files: text files, screenshots, and recordings.
- Screenshots should be saved as png.
- Recordings should be saved as mp4.
- When asked to save content to a text file, make use of the function save_to_text_file.
- When asked to save a screenshot you have taken, make use of the function save_to_png.
- When asked to save a recording you have produced, make use of the function save_to_mp4.

11. GENERAL RULE REGARDING SUBTASKS:
- When you are given a task involving several subtasks, and one of the subtasks fails, assess whether the other ones are dependent on its success.
  Do this for each subtask individually. If a subtask can be addressed without that prior one having been successfully, ALWAYS execute it.
  In other words, ONLY EVER skip a subtask if its requirements are not given.
