When building chatbots, among many others concerns, one often faces three main challenges: stability, precision, and deployment. In this blog post, we'll explore how a new Python framework, [Burr](https://burr.dagworks.io/), combined with Hal9's capabilities, can make these challenges a thing of the past.

Why these three matter so much:
- Stability: A stable chatbot ensures consistent performance and reliability, even when handling complex inputs or high user traffic. Instability can lead to frustrating user experiences, which may damage trust in your product.

- Precision: AI agents frequently hallucinate, which makes accuracy and relevance critical for deploying applications at an industry-ready level.

- Deployment: getting your chatbot out of the development environment and into production smoothly is often a challenge. Deployment should be seamless, scalable, and adaptable to your existing infrastructure.

## Introducing Burr
Burr is a lightweight Python framework for building tool-using AI agents, simplifying the creation of chatbots that can interact with APIs, databases, or custom tools. With Burr, you can:
- Quickly prototype, test and debug agents with minimal effort.

- Integrate external tools and APIs seamlessly.

- Build multi-step workflows for more complex tasks.

- Visualize the decisions each agent makes and see how they communicate to each other.

By combining Burr with Hal9's user-friendly platform for deploying AI-powered solutions, you can build chatbots that are not only intelligent but also robust and production-ready.

## The Hal9 Advantage
When you pair Burr with Hal9‚Äôs powerful AI deployment platform, you unlock a streamlined path to creating production-ready chatbots. Hal9 makes it easy to:

- Deploy with Confidence: Transition seamlessly from development to production with minimal friction.

- Scale Effortlessly: Handle high user traffic without compromising stability or precision.

- Simplify the Process: Hal9‚Äôs platform is designed with accessibility in mind, making it easy to deploy even the most complex agents.


## Example: Burr on Hal9

Let's walk through how to build a simple weather chatbot on hal9 using Burr. This chatbot can interact with external tools to provide precise and relevant responses to user queries.

### 1. Set Up Burr

Start by installing Burr and creating a basic agent.

```bash 
pip install burr
``` 

### 2. Create Tools
Next, implement a few tools for the agent to use. In our case, we chose to use [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)'s API to fetch weather data. Our tools include:
- `get_current_weather`: Fetches the current weather conditions for specified coordinates.

- `get_weather_forecast`: Retrieves the weather forecast for the next few days for given coordinates.

- `get_coordinates`: Resolves a location name into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) to query the weather API accurately.

Each of these tools uses OpenWeatherMap's API to gather precise weather information, whether it's real-time conditions or forecasts.

### 3. Implement the chatbot's logic with Burr
With the tools ready, it‚Äôs time to define the chatbot‚Äôs logic. Burr allows you to construct multi-step workflows where agents can dynamically select and execute the right tools. Below is the full implementation:

```python
import hal9 as h9
import json
from openai import OpenAI

from burr.core import ApplicationBuilder, State, default, expr
from burr.core.action import action

## Import user-defined API functions for the agents to use
from weather_utils import *

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.hal9.com/proxy/server=https://api.openai.com/v1/",
    api_key = "h9" 
)

## Burr actions are encapsulated, stateless operations triggered by state 
## transitions, defined to interact with workflows, models, or external APIs.
@action(reads = [], writes = ['messages'])
def user_input(state: State) -> State:
    prompt = input()
    message = {
        'role': 'user',
        'content': prompt
    }

    return state.update(prompt = prompt).append(messages = message)

@action(reads = ['messages'], writes = ['response'])
def orchestrator(state: State):
    system_prompt = (
        "You are a helpful agent."
        "You work for an app specialized in giving meteorological information to users."
        "Your task is to decide if the last users query needs to be answered using the weather API."
        "If so, your reply should only be 'API'. If not, you can reply freely to the user."
    )
    message = {'role': 'system', 'content': system_prompt}
    
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        messages = [message] + state['messages'],
        model = 'gpt-3.5-turbo'
    ).choices[0].message.content
    
    return state.update(response = response)

@action(reads = ['messages', 'prompt'], writes = ['location', 'request_type', 'count'])
def interpret_prompt(state: State) -> State:
    system_prompt = (
        "You are a geography expert." 
        "Your task is to find the specific location from where the user is requesting weather data.")

    ## More left out (big system prompt and response format) for brevity ...
    
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model = 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06',
        messages = state['messages'] + messages,
        response_format = response_format
    ).choices[0].message.content

    return state.update(**json.loads(response))

@action(reads = [], writes = ['prompt'])
def ask_location(state: State) -> State:
    reply = 'The location is unclear, please try again with a different prompt.'
    print(reply)

    new_state = state.append(messages = {'role': 'assistant', 'content': reply})
    h9.save('messages', new_state['messages'], hidden = True)

    return new_state

@action(reads = ["location"], writes = ['lat', 'lon'])
def coordinates(state: State) -> State:
    info = get_coordinates(state["location"])[0]
    return state.update(lat = info['lat'],  lon = info['lon'])

@action(reads = ["lat", "lon"], writes = ["weather_result"])
def current_weather(state: State) -> State:
    info = get_current_weather(state["lat"], state["lon"])
    return state.update(weather_result = info)

@action(reads = ["lat", "lon", "count"], writes = ["weather_result"])
def weather_forecast(state: State) -> State:
    info = get_weather_forecast(state["lat"], state["lon"], cnt = state["count"])
    return state.update(weather_result = info)

@action(reads = ["prompt", "weather_result"], writes = ["messages"])
def interpret_result(state: State) -> State:
    result = json.dumps(state["weather_result"], indent = 2)
    system_prompt = (
        "You are an expert meteorologist."
        "Your task is to interpret the asistants weather response and reply the requested information to the user."
    )
    messages = [
        {'role': 'system', 'content': system_prompt},
        {'role': 'user', 'content': state['prompt']},
        {'role': 'assistant', 'content': result}
    ]

    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model = 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
        messages = messages
    ).choices[0].message.content

    new_state = state.update(response = response).append(messages = {'role':'assistant', 'content': response})    
    h9.save('messages', new_state['messages'], hidden = True)

    return new_state

@action(reads=['response'], writes = [])
def reply(state: State) -> State: 
    print(state['response'])

    return state

## Now create the app. A simple as adding all actions, 
## and defining how they are related to each other!
app = (
    ApplicationBuilder()
    .with_actions(
        user_input,
        orchestrator,
        interpret_prompt, 
        ask_location, 
        coordinates, 
        current_weather, 
        weather_forecast,
        interpret_result,
        reply)
    .with_transitions(
        ("user_input", "orchestrator"),
        ("orchestrator", "interpret_prompt", expr("'API' in response")),
        ("orchestrator", "reply"),
        ("interpret_prompt", "ask_location", when(location = 'uncertain')),
        ("interpret_prompt", "coordinates"),
        ("coordinates", "current_weather", when(request_type = 'current')),
        ("coordinates", "weather_forecast"),
        ("current_weather", "interpret_result"),
        ("weather_forecast", "interpret_result"),
        ("interpret_result", "reply"))
    .with_state(
        messages = h9.load('messages', [{'role': 'assistant', 'content': "Hi! üå§Ô∏è I'm your weather assistant. Tell me a location, and I'll share the forecast with you! ‚õÖ"}]))
    .with_entrypoint("user_input")
    .build()
)

app.run(halt_after = ['ask_location', 'reply'])
```
