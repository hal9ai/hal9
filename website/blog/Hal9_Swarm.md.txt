## Using OpenAI Swarm with Hal9: Unlocking New Potential for Enterprise AI

As enterprises seek innovative ways to harness the power of AI, combining the best tools for flexibility, speed, and collaborative insights becomes essential. OpenAI Swarm is a promising approach that leverages multiple instances of AI models working together in a coordinated manner, effectively mimicking a "swarm intelligence" system. When paired with Hal9—a platform optimized for customizing and deploying generative AI—OpenAI Swarm opens new horizons for enterprise-level solutions.

In this post, we’ll dive into what OpenAI Swarm is, why it’s a valuable asset for enterprise use, and how integrating it with Hal9 can transform your AI-driven applications. We'll also walk through some example code and provide visuals generated with this integration.

### What is OpenAI Swarm?

OpenAI Swarm is a system designed to run multiple AI models in parallel, each contributing to a collective response based on the input provided. By orchestrating a “swarm” of AI models that analyze the same prompt from various perspectives, OpenAI Swarm generates richer, more nuanced responses. This can be incredibly useful for applications requiring deep analytical insights, creative brainstorming, or decision-making in complex scenarios.

### Why Use OpenAI Swarm with Hal9?

Hal9 makes it simple for businesses to customize and deploy AI models at scale. By integrating OpenAI Swarm with Hal9, enterprises can harness the combined power of multiple AI models tailored specifically for their unique needs. This setup is especially advantageous in scenarios where a single model may not capture the full spectrum of insights required.

### Example Code

```python
import json
import hal9 as h9
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from swarm import Swarm, Agent, repl
from recommendations import book_recommendation, comic_recommendation, movie_recommendation

load_dotenv()

# Define transfer functions
def transfer_to_receptionist():
    return receptionist

def transfer_to_book_expert():
    return book_expert

def transfer_to_comic_expert():
    return comic_expert

def transfer_to_movie_expert():
    return movie_expert

# Define expert agents
book_expert = Agent(
    name="Book Expert",
    instructions="You are a classic books expert. Provide book recommendations. If the conversation drifts away, return to the receptionist.",
    functions=[book_recommendation, transfer_to_receptionist],
)

comic_expert = Agent(
    name="Comic Expert",
    instructions="You are an expert in comics. Provide comic recommendations. If the conversation drifts away, return to the receptionist.",
    functions=[comic_recommendation, transfer_to_receptionist],
)

movie_expert = Agent(
    name="Movie Expert",
    instructions="You are an expert in movies. Provide movie recommendations. If the conversation drifts away, return to the receptionist.",
    functions=[movie_recommendation, transfer_to_receptionist],
)

receptionist = Agent(
    name="Receptionist",
    instructions="You are a receptionist. Direct users to a book, comic, or movie expert based on their input.",
    functions=[transfer_to_book_expert, transfer_to_comic_expert, transfer_to_movie_expert],
)

client = Swarm()
messages = h9.load('messages', [])
agents = {'Receptionist': receptionist, 'Comic Expert': comic_expert, 'Movie Expert': movie_expert}
agent = agents[h9.load('last_agent', 'Receptionist')]

# Handle user input
user_input = input()
messages.append({"role": "user", "content": user_input})

response = client.run(agent=agent, messages=messages)

for message in response.messages:
    if message["role"] == "assistant":
        print(f"{message['sender']}: {message['content']}")

messages.extend(response.messages)
agent = response.agent

h9.save('messages', messages, hidden=True)
h9.save('last_agent', agent.name, hidden=True)
