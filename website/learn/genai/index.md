# Concepts

Generative Artificial Intelligence (**GenAI**) is a version of Artificial Intelligence (**AI**) that is good at generating content: text, images, sounds, videos, code, etc.

The previous version of GenAI (referred to as AI) was based on Deep Neural Networks (**DNN**), which are brain-inspired math equations optimized for content classification. For example, it enabled computers to identify if pixels in an image represent a cat or dog, or if some text is written in Spanish or English.

GenAI uses AI in the opposite way -- not to classify, but to generate new content. For example, to generate a pixel image of a cat, or a response to some text in Spanish. A response from ChatGPT would be another example of GenAI in action.

ChatGPT popularized using a chat interface to interact with generative AI, other services like MidJourney are using existing communication interfaces like Discord. We are starting to see other interfaces like ChatGPT-4o that run in mobile phones and can understand voice and video without a chat interface, in the not so distant future we might see generative applications that run in Zoom or even on robots like Tesla's Optimus.

New developer jobs will likely require writing code for such new applications to help GenAI learn faster, modify their behavior, or solve harder problems.

For example, even if an AI or a robot was capable of flying an airplane autonomously, developers might want to write code that double checks that the landing is safe, connects to the best weather services, provides flight updates to passengers, etc.

We don't know exactly what the new AI will look like and how our jobs or world will transform, but we are optimistic that GenApps will help us solve hard problems the world is facing in healthcare, education, climate, energy, space exploration, entertainment, and so on.

It is expected that AI systems will continue evolving, it's hard to predict how; but we can learn from expert interviews to understand the potential and implications of this new wave of AI.
