# Hal9: Create and Share Powerful AIs

Hal9 is a platform designed to simplify the creation and sharing of powerful AIs. Unlike traditional chatbots, Hal9 enables you to go beyond basic chat interfaces and the generic capabilities offered by services like ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude.

While your AI can include a chat interface when needed, it can also take other forms, such as APIs or applications for tasks like image uploads, providing unmatched flexibility.

With Hal9, your AI can securely connect to private enterprise datasets, integrate seamlessly with enterprise communication tools, build robust applications, and leverage powerful open-source libraries for customization. To ensure data security, your AI operates exclusively within your own cloud environment, eliminating the risk of exposing private resources—even to Hal9 itself.

The Hal9 interface is a user-friendly web application. Its intuitive sidebar allows you to explore existing AIs, create new ones, share your work, and integrate AIs with tools like Slack, making it easy to bring your ideas to life and streamline communication workflows.

Hal9's developer interface offers a robust open-source library, allowing developers to build AIs of any complexity. Developers can write and modify code directly within Hal9’s user interface or deploy from external services like GitHub.

This flexibility empowers business users to quickly create AIs tailored to their needs, while developers can easily enhance and scale these AIs with advanced features, ensuring they meet the specific requirements of the business.
