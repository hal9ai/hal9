# Creating AIs

You can create an AI with Hal9 in just a few seconds. The first step is to use the sidebar and click "create".

<center><a href="/create"><ThemedImage src="hal9-create" /></a></center>

You will then be asked to fill out a few fields to customize your chatbot, starting with a name.

## Name

The name defines the title for your chatbot and also the URL path used to access it.

## Description

The description field services two purposes. First, it is used when browsing additional details for your chatbot. Secondly, some templates use the description to customize the experience and the behavior of your AIs.

For example, the description field might be used as the system prompt in some cases, see also [prompts](../genai/prompts) concept section.

## Data

Optionally, you can upload additional data to your AI. A very common use case is to attach a document in the form of a PDF that can be used to extract additional context to answer questions. You can also attach numerical data in the form of spreadsheets in CSV or Excel files. For large datasets, you can connect a database with all the information needed to answer data questions.

## Welcome Message

The welcome message for your AI can be customized. This is a great opportunity to set the tone of the conversation and give the user hints as to what to ask or how to interact with your AI.

For example, you might want to explicitly state what you are knowledgeable for: "Hello, I can answer revenue related questions." or start collecting important information like: "What questions can I answer from this website?".

## Create

Once you click the "create" button, your AI will be created. By default, the access will be private, accessible to only your account. Later on, we will explore how to share your AI.
