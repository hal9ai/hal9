# Using AIs

The most common interface to interact with your AI is through a chat session. This chat session opens by default whenever you open an AI in Hal9 Platform.

Notice that AIs will greet you with a customized message chosen by the author of the AI.

## Prompt Input

You can input prompts (send messages) to your AI using the bottom textbox from the chat interface. The nature of the inputs are dependent on what kind of AIs you are using.

AI's created with Hal9 Platform support a broad range of tasks from answering generic questions, to generating images and processing documents and numerical datasets. However, other ones might be specialized in specific tasks or data sources.

## Submit Prompt

You can submit prompts by hitting enter, or by clicking the "submit" buttom in the lower-right area of the chat interface.

## User Messages

Messages you send are aligned to the right side of the chat interface. Once a user message is submitted, the prompt input area will be disabled until the AI finishes processing the submitted message.

## AI Messages

AI messages are aligned to the left side of the chat interface. Just like messaging people in communication channels, AIs will take different time to reply to messages. Some that are answering generic questions can answer almost instantaneously, AIs that process large amounts of data tend to take longer, AIs that answer complex questions can take even longer times.

For example, one could ask "Is the world flat?" and expect a fast reply, compared to the question "Please calculate as many digits of Pi as you can" would likely take too long or potentially never end.
